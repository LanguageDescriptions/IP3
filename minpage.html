Any sound can be recorded on a computer and saved as a file of numbers, which can then be played back. Here we have an example of two words of Logoori. On all of these pages, you can press ‘play’ to hear the word. I recommend that you do not listen to these recordings right now, try to figure out the words based just on the numbers and pictures, then come back here to listen to see if you were right.
