<b>Longer Analytic Sketches</b>
</p><p>
Below are two two longer languages analyses, designed to show how a linguist would construct a sketch of an aspect of a phonological system. Complete analyses of all of the phonology of either of these languages would require a whole book, what is offered here is coherent subsets of the language, also written in "objective reporting" style, not "textbook explanation" style. Reading actual language descriptions, not textbook problem-solving excerpts, is essential to professional development as a phonologist.

<a href= "Matumbi.pdf">Matumbi.</a> There are competing conventions for language names: Matumbi is the general-public name of the language of people (also a British reggae band, and I have no idea where they got the name from). In the language, the language is called [kimatʊ́ʊmbɪ]
